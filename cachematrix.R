#Project 2 Assignment, R Programming, Build (R version 3.1.3, RStudio version 0.98.1091)
##Purpose: a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
###The function makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" that can cache the inverse of the matrix
###The function cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special matrix or retrieves the inverse from the cache

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
